      <p>The other player plays as a <strong>runner</strong>, which is where the game gets its name. Their goal is to infiltrate the corps defenses, steal their agendas, and foil their plans. The two sides have different cards to represent this, and the asymetrical nature of the game leads to exciting tactical battles.</p>
